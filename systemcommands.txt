	This is a document describing the user account settings and information that are common with windows xp/2k.

First off, I'd like to discuss how to set up a user account, and a few of the most common options and commands associated with doing so.
Even though it's quite easy just to sit down as administrator at a computer, click a couple times, type in a password, and have a working 
user account, sometimes you don't have that GUI to work with. Say, for instance, you wanted to create a small utility that would automate the
process of setting up user accounts on a network. And lets say this network is about 1500 miles away. How would you do this? You probably 
wouldn't fly over to the network, and visit each individual node. No, you'd want a program that you could do this with without actually being 
there! Here's were these commands come in. Try these commands as you read them.
	NOTE: All the output of all these commands can be sent to a file by simply adding >filename.txt to the very end of the command

	I actually go over many of XP/2k's "net" commands. these include sharing out folders, adding usernames/accounts, setting priviliges,
starting/stopping network services, and allowing programs to run as a certain user.
1) The NET USER commands
	NET USER is how windows XP/2k adds users to a computer, as well as changes passwords and setting options. You can only set up limited
	accounts using NET USER, but I'll explain how to make them admin later in the document.
	COMMANDS:
	/add			-adds the user. ONLY USE IF THE ACCOUNT DOESN'T EXIST AND YOU WANT TO CREATE IT.
	/domain			-performs the operation on the domain controller (only if the computer is a domain controller)
	/Active:YES/NO		-Specifies whether or not the account is able to accept logins (active or not)
	/comment:"Comment text"	-Leaves a comment. I'd put things like when i made the account/what computer/and why.
	/countrycode:nnn	-country code. It's supposed to load the language files for that country, however you may have to have the 
				language files installed on your computer in order to use this feature.
	/expires:NEVER		-expiration date of the account. once the date hits, goodbye account. also takes 
				mm/dd/yyyy;dd/mm/yyyy;mmm/dd/yyy formats.
	/fullname:"name"	-the full name of the user.
	/homedir:path		-the path of the user's home directory. it will NOT create a directory, it has to already exist.
	/passwordchg:YES/NO	-allows/disallows user to change their own password
	/passwordreq:YES/NO	-specifies if there is a password required.
	/profilepath:path	-points to the profile path in the registry.
	/scriptpath:path	-path to the user's login script. can't be an abosulte path. must be something like:
				%systemroot%\system32\Repl\Import\Scripts
	/times:all		-VERY COOL. opens up a little window in time where you have a chance to use the account. if you try and
				log in at any other time(s) than those specified, you won't be able to. limited to 1hour increments. To
				set up a user account that can only be accessed on mondays between 4am and 5am, and wednesdays through 
				fridays between 12noon and 6pm, use this:
				net user USERNAME /times:M,4AM-5AM;W-F,12PM-6PM
				(abberviations used(you can also spell them out)): M,T,W,Th,F,Sa,Su
	/usercomment:"comment"	-specifies that an admin can change the user comments for that account.
	/workstations:*		-Okay. this one's kinda  cool in itself. You can list up to 8 workstations that can log in as this account
				or use the * asterisk to allow ANY computer to log in as that account.
				example: net user USERNAME /workstations:MyPC1,MyPc2,MyPC3
	/delete			-removes the account.

		EXAMPLES:
			
	To create a simple limited account for the user "USER" with the password being PASSWORD:
		net user USER PASSWORD /add
	To change the password for the account USER to a more secure password, such as CF43KF923K
		net user USER CF43KF923K
	To Remove the account:
		net user USER /delete
	To make the account USER again, give it the password PASSWORD, disallow password changing, set the login times to Thursdays between
	11am and 3pm, and to allow ANY user from any machine to log in:
		net user USER PASSWORD /add /passwordchg:NO /times:Th,11am-3pm /workstations:*
Now that we have a good understanding of that, we'll move on. 

2) Now the net localgroup settings. These allow you to change the groups(access rights) in which an account is assigned.
	
	/comment:"Comment"	-Adds a comment for a new or existing group.
	/domain			-performs the operation on the domain controller
	/add			-makes the group OR adds a user to the group. Say you wanted to make a new group "MYGROUP"
				net localgroup MYGROUP /add
				then add an existing user to that group:
				net localgroup MYGROUP USER /add
	/delete			-removes a group or user from a group
	NOTE: The name(s) you add to a group must be seperated with a space.
	COMMON GROUPS: (found using net localgroup:
		Administrators		-all access to all types of options
		Backup Operators	-A type of local or global group that contains the user rights you need to back up and restore files 
					and folders. Members of the Backup Operators group can back up and restore files and folders 
					regardless of ownership, permissions, encryption, or auditing settings.
		Debugger Users
		Guests			-very limited accounts.
		HelpServiceGroup
		Network Configuration Operators
		Power Users
		Remote Desktop Users
		Replicator
		Users			-fairly limited accounts. all permissions specified by admin
	EXAMPLE:	
		Set up the user account "USER" to be an administrator:
			net localgroup Administrator USER /add
3) And now for the net view command! This one allows you to see a list of the domains/shares/and/or resources being shared by a computer.
	\\IP or NAME		-shows the shared resources you want to view
	/domain			-specifies the domain for which you want to view available computers if you don't use this, it'll show all
				the domains on the network
	/network:sw		-displays all the available servers on A NetWare network.
	EXAMPLE:
		View all the shares (both resource and NetBIOS/BEUI on the local machine
			net view \\127.0.0.1
			or
			net view \\MYMACHINENAME

4) Net Accounts. A wonderful little command that updates the user accounts database and modifies password and logon requirements for ALL accounts.
	/forcelogoff:NO		-sets the number of minutes to wait before ending a user's session with the server. 
	/minpwlen:number	-the minimum password length for all accounts
	/maxpwage:Unlimited	-sets the number of days a user's password is valid. has to be longer than minpwage
	/minpwage:days		-This sets the number of days MINIMUM ebfore a user can change their password. Theorectically you can set it
				to UP TO 49,710 days.
	/uniquepw:number	-user can't repeat password for the specified number of password changes.
	/domain			-performs the operation on the domain controller, otherwise it'll only be performed on the local machine
	
	EXAMPLE:
		Make all accounts have a MINIMUM password length of 6 and a MAXIMUM password length of 14, and they must change it every
		12 days.
	net accounts /winpwlen:6 /macpwlen:14 maxpwage:12

5) The NET USE command connects and/or disconnects a user from a shared resource, as well as displays info about the connections.
	Devicename		-assigns a name to connect to the resource(disk and print only) or specifies the device to be disconnected.
	\\IP\sharename		-Specifies the computer name(in place of IP) and the shared resource.
	\volume			-Specifies the NetWare Volume on the server. have to have client service for netware installed and running.
	password		-the password needed to connect to the shared resource. use * to make a prompt for the pass.
	\user			-specifies a different name with which the connection will be made
	DomainName		-specifies another domain
	UserName		-specifies the user name with which to log on
	DottedDomainName	-specifies fully-qualified domain name for the domain where the user accont exists.
	/savecred		-stores provided credntials for resuse
	/smartcard		-network connection is to use credentials on a smart card
	/delete			-cancels specified network connect. use * asterisk to cancel ALL network connections.
	/Persisntant:YES/NO	-YES saves all conneions as they are made, NO does not.
	/home			-connects to the home directory
	
	EXAMPLE:
		COnnect to 4.64.115.255 share MyShare
	net use \\4.64.115.255\MyShare
		Disconnect from MyShare
	net use \\4.64.115.255\MyShare /delete
		Map (add the drive to My Computer) networked drive
	net use * \\4.64.115.255\MyShare

6) Net Session is used to view/disconnect from connections
	\\ip			-lists connections
	/delete			-dosconnects connection
	
	EXAMPLE:
		view all network connections
	net session
		Disconnect all network sessions
	net session /delete		
		delete only only specified connection 4.64.115.255
	net session 4.64.115.255 /delete

7) Net Group is for adding, displyaing, or modifying global groups in DOMAINS only
	groupname		-specifies the name of the group to add/exapnd/or remove.
	/comment:"comment"	-adds a comment. wow what a surprise there.
	/domain			-performs the operation on the domain controller/otherwise just on local machine
	/add			-adds a group (or user) to the group.
	/delete			-removes a group or user from the group.

	EXAMPLE:	
		To add a new group MYGROUP to the domain:
	net group MYGROUP /add /domain
		to add a few new users NEWUSER1, NEWUSER2, and NEWUSER3 to the group
	net group MYGROUP NEWUSER1 NEWUSER2 NEWUSER3 /add

8) Net share is for managing shared resources. Say, for example, you wanted to share/disallow a shared resource (netBIOS)
	/users:number		-maximum number of users on shared resource at any one time
	/unlimited		-unlimited users on shared directory at any one time
	/remark:"Text"		-leaves a comment on the share
	/cache:mode		-Automatic:enables offline client caching with automatic reintegration
				manual: enables offline lient caching with manual reintegration
				no: advises client that offline cahcing is not appropriate :)
	/delete 		-removes share
	
	EXAMPLE:
		To share the entire F: directory
	net share SHARENAME=F:\
		To stop sharing F:
	net share SHARENAME /delete
		NOTE: If you do share a folder using net share, it is my experience that it gives complete read/write access to the share :)

9) Net Stop / Net Start / Net Pause /Net Continue start and stop or pause network services. Services that can be paused have an *asterisk 
next to them
These include:
	-alerter			warns about access and security issues.
	-browser			maintains up-to-datelist of computers on the network and list of programs that request it
	-"Client Service for netware"	only if it's installed
	-clipbook			cut/copy/paste text/graphics/docs over network
	-dhcp client			can't stop this service
	-file replication		file replication service
	-messenger			enables computer to recieve messages.
       *-netlogon			verifies logon requests and controls domain-wide replication
       *-"nt LM security suppoert provider"	Only if it's installed
	-"Remote Access Connection Manager"	only if it's installed
	-"Routing and remote access"	starts/stops this service
	-rpclocator			allows distributd application to use the RPC name service
       *-schedule			task scheduler
       *-server				share server resources over network
	-spooler			print spool service.
	-"TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper"	enables NetBIOS over TCP/IP
	-UPS				Uninterruptable power supply
       *-Workstation			if stopped, computer can't access networked resources

10) net name is used in conjunction with the messenger service. the messenger service must be started for messages to be recieved/sent. 
	NAMES CAN ONLY BE UP TO 15 CHARACTERS!
	/add			-adds a name or "alias" to the messenger service not required
	/delete			-removes an alias from the messenger service

	EXAMPLE:
		once the messenger service is started, view all names in messenger service:
	net name
		once the messenger service is started, add a name "USERNAME" to your service:
	net name USERNAME
		remove name "USERNAME" from messenger service
	net name USERNAME /delete

11) net print is used to view/delay/or cancel print jobs in a print queue
	\\ip			-REQUIRED. can be computer name
	\QueueName		-if no specified queue, lists all of them
	/hold			-delays the job, allowing other jobs to pass it
	/release		-realeases /hold job
	/delete			-delete specified print job

	EXAMPLE:
		view all print jobs on 4.64.115.255
	net print \\4.64.115.255

12) net computer is used to add a computer to the domain
	\\computername		-specifies what computer we're talking about. can also use ip addresses.
	/add			-add computer to domain

That's all this time. Now you know the most typical and useful commands for both local and remote administration (remote only when applied correctly!).
Enjoy!
